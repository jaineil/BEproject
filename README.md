Visual Neural Network Toolkit allows the user to draw the neural network model on a canvas with ‘Drag & Drop’ functionality. 
It then lets the user add the necessary dataset as input and set the hyperparameters using drop-down menus. 
The toolkit in return, automatically generates a Python code of the model drawn on the canvas, trains it with the said dataset on Kaggle and provides a trained Python file as output. 
This file can then be integrated with the application’s source code. 
It also generates a graph of the trained model’s architecture on TensorBoard.
In addition to this, usage of cloud technology on the backend, implies that no burden of training or testing falls on user’s computer. 
Thereby, beginners with computers of limited specifications can still use Sequential Deep Learning models within their projects.

Akashdeep Singh, Dhairya Nagda & I (Jaineil Mandavia) built this by drawing inspiration from Tensorflow Playground, Nvidia DIGITS and MS Azure ML Visual Interface. 
This is our B.E. project for our degree in Computer Engineering.
